                 <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
                    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.
                    up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.Humans
                     keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised 
                     for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).
                     Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their 
                     necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However,
                      in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The
                       identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and 
                       in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called
                        a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy 
                        protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds 
                        these are more prominent in males.
